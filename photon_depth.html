        <h1 class="section-title mt-5">Photon Optical Depth</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="section-body"> A few hundred million years after the big bang, large structures of hydrogen and dark matter cooled and collapsed under their own gravity, forming the first stars. The ultraviolet photons these stars emitted had enough energy to ionize the neutral cosmic gas permeating through space, resulting in the release of free electrons. Thus began the epoch of reionization. The new free electrons introduced a small probability of Thompson scattering the CMB photons streaming through the universe at this time. The amount of scattering is dependent on the optical depth at reionization, \(\tau\), which represents the opacity of free electrons to CMB radiation. We can quantify this effect by considering a photon from direction \( \hat{\pmb{n}}\) with temperature \( T(\hat{\pmb{n}})=\bar{T}[1+\Theta(\hat{\pmb{n}})]\), where \(\bar{T}\) refers to the mean temperature of the CMB and \(\Theta(\hat{n})\) represents the temperature anisotropy in that direction. The probability of the photon passing through space unscattered is \(e^{-\tau}\), while the probability of the photon scattering is \( 1 - e^{-\tau} \). From this, the temperature observed should follow:</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">\( T(\hat{\pmb{n}})=\bar{T}[1+\Theta(\hat{\pmb{n}})e^{-\tau}] \)</p>
        <p class="section-body">Thus, the effects of any anisotropies are uniformly reduced by \(e^{-\tau}\). This effect only occurs at smaller angular scales (higher multipoles corresponding to \(l \ge 10 \)), since at the time of reionization, the horizon size -- the distance at which causal connections can occur -- was smaller and thus limited the angular size that could be affected.</p>
        <p class="section-body">Increasing \(\tau\) also results in an increase in power in the EE spectrum at low multiples. Since we keep the size of the first peak constant, the perceived decrease in amplitude at lower multiples is actually representative of an increase in amplitude at high multiples, indicating a polarization effect during reionization. After scattering, incident radiation becomes polarized transverse to the direction of propagation. Thus, as these photons propagate through the universe during reionization and scatter off of free electrons, a resulting net polarization is generated. Increasing the optical depth increases the amount of scattering events that contribute to the polarization. This effect occurs at angular scales smaller than the size of the universe at the time of reionization.</p>
